Progress: [███████░░░] 20% (7/35)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: ~3.2 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Security | 5/5 | ~17.5m | ~3.5m |
| 2 - Auth Consolidation | 2/3 | ~6m | ~3m |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Supabase Auth as sole auth system (remove custom JWT)
- Supabase as sole database (remove Neon adapter)
- Tiered AI Coach: Claude for complex, OpenAI for simple
- Vercel as sole deployment target
- Freemium model with unified pricing
- [01-01] Read Supabase env from c.env at request time (Vercel per-request injection)
- [01-01] Use hono/combine except() for public route whitelist
- [01-03] Web Crypto API for Stripe signature verification (no SDK needed)
- [01-04] CORS origin allowlist with CORS_ORIGINS env var for flexibility
- [01-02] Inline checkOwnership pattern for IDOR protection (over route middleware)
- [01-02] Excluded social/communities/feed from IDOR (target-action, not identity)
- [01-02] Deferred verifyRelationshipMembership to Phase 3
- [01-04] Admin analytics page route protected with inline requireAuth + requireAdmin
- [01-05] Rate limiting gracefully skips when Upstash not configured (dev mode passthrough)
- [01-05] Kept auth-specific in-memory rate limiting separate from global API rate limiting
- [01-05] Sanitize-on-input for all UGC (defense-in-depth with Hono TSX auto-escape)
- [02-01] Store @supabase/ssr response headers on Hono context for cookie relay
- [02-01] Rename createServerClient to createAnonClient to avoid @supabase/ssr name collision
- [02-02] PKCE code exchange via /callback endpoint for password reset flow
- [02-02] Pass tokens as query params from callback to reset page (server-rendered pages can't read hash)
- [02-02] Set auth cookies after password reset so user stays logged in

### Pending Todos

- Consolidate custom JWT requireAuth (auth.ts) with Supabase requireAuth (middleware.ts) — noted for Phase 2
- Configure Upstash Redis credentials in Vercel (UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL, UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN)
- Configure Resend SMTP in Supabase dashboard (host: smtp.resend.com, port: 465, user: resend, password: RESEND_API_KEY)

### Blockers/Concerns

- 58 v1 requirements across 10 phases — aggressive scope for ASAP timeline
- Zero existing tests means refactoring has high regression risk
- Phase 1 (security) complete — all 5 plans executed
- Two separate requireAuth implementations exist (auth.ts JWT vs middleware.ts Supabase) — social.ts and messaging.ts still use the JWT version
- Supabase SMTP not yet configured — password reset emails won't deliver until manual dashboard setup is done
